# Tools_Cs_py
In this repository there are 4 basic tools mostly occupied in cybersecurity.

1. binario.py (It is responsible for converting any ordinary number or int to binary.)

2. findip.py (When you open it, the name of the computer and its private IP address are displayed.)

3. passwcrack.py (It works for basic hashes, along with a basic dictionary it is capable of decrypting a password.)

4. portscan.py (It scans the open ports with any IP address, it is a very basic tool because if you have other more powerful ones, it would be recommended to omit this one.)


All tools run with:

""" python (name.py) """
